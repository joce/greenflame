# AGENTS - Project Greenflame

This repository builds `greenflame.exe`, a Windows-only screenshot and annotation tool.

Agents MUST follow this file and the authoritative docs linked below.

---

## Mission

Greenflame is a high-correctness screenshot tool designed for:

- mixed-DPI, multi-monitor Windows setups
- capture-first region selection (capture, then overlay selection)
- optional in-place annotation
- optional CLI mode

Correctness, especially DPI and coordinate behavior, takes priority over convenience.

## Authoritative Docs

- [docs/build.md](docs/build.md): configure/build/lint/static-analysis expectations
- [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md): test philosophy, build/run commands, and policy
- [README.md](README.md): user-facing behavior, CLI semantics, and exit code table

Before considering any task complete:

- all required builds in `docs/build.md` must pass
- all required test runs in `docs/testing.md` must pass

## Platform & Toolchain (authoritative)

- OS: **Windows 11**
- Compiler: **MSVC (Visual Studio 2026 (18.2.1 or later))** (primary), **Clang (clang-cl)** supported
- Build system: **CMake**
- Generator: **Ninja** (preferred) or **Visual Studio**
- Language standard: **C++20**

## Commit Messages

All commits must have a prefix type. Refuse to commit without one — no exceptions.

The four allowed types (all lowercase):

- `fix: one-liner` — bug fix
- `change: one-liner` — behavioral change
- `internal: one-liner` — refactor / internal work
- `feat: short description\n\nbody` — new feature; body explaining the change is required unless the feature is very simple and a one-liner is explicitly requested

`fix`, `change`, and `internal` are one-liners by default; a body is only added if explicitly requested.

If asked to commit as anything other than these four types, ask for clarification unless the user has already explained why.

When asked to commit, the build rules do not apply

## Repository Structure (authoritative)

- `src/greenflame/`
  Win32 application shell and OS integration
  - `main.cpp`: process entry, CLI parse handoff, single-instance tray guard
  - `greenflame_app.*`: app lifecycle, message loop, wiring between UI events and controllers
  - `win/`: Win32 adapter layer (window classes, Direct2D overlay UI, tray UI, GDI capture, file dialogs/startup, concrete service implementations)

- `src/greenflame_core/`
  Testable core logic and controller policies
  - geometry/rect and monitor rules
  - selection and overlay interaction state machine
  - output path and save policy logic
  - CLI/application orchestration via injected service interfaces

- `tests/`
  GoogleTest unit coverage for `greenflame_core` behavior using mocks/fakes for service interfaces

- `docs/`
  Authoritative build and testing instructions, plus focused design notes

## Architecture Notes

Greenflame is controller-centric rather than strict MVC.

- `greenflame_core::AppController` owns capture/save/CLI orchestration and policy decisions.
- `greenflame_core::OverlayController` owns overlay interaction state and action decisions.
- `src/greenflame/win/` owns Win32-specific adapters and concrete service implementations.
- `OverlayWindow` and `TrayWindow` translate Win32 events into controller calls and apply returned actions.
- Keep as much behavior as possible in core; keep OS/UI code in `greenflame`.
- Prefer OOP and encapsulation with clear ownership/lifecycle boundaries over global/procedural state.

---

## Rendering, DPI, and Coordinate Rules (critical)

- Process is **Per-Monitor DPI Aware v2**
- Internal coordinate truth is **physical pixels**
- Explicit types MUST be used:
  - `*Px` for physical pixels
  - `*Dip` for device-independent pixels
- No implicit coordinate conversions
- DPI conversion must happen explicitly and in one place per boundary crossing

Capture/overlay stack (current):

- Capture: GDI virtual-desktop capture before overlay display (capture-first)
- Overlay rendering: Direct2D/DirectWrite in a fullscreen borderless topmost window
- Tray toast rendering: GDI/GDI+ (intentional small Win32 UI path)
- No Direct3D/DirectComposition in the current path

Breaking these rules is a correctness bug.

## Coding Rules for Agents

- Do not use `goto`.
- Indent with 4 spaces (no tabs).
- Prefer forward declarations in headers when possible; include full definitions in `.cpp`.
- Do not include standard library or Windows headers directly in non-PCH files. Add needed headers to the relevant PCH (`src/greenflame/pch.h`, `src/greenflame_core/pch.h`, or `tests/pch.h`).
- Do not introduce third-party libraries without explicit justification.
- Do not bypass or simplify DPI logic.
- Do not move testable orchestration/policy logic into the GUI executable.
- Treat the repository `.clang-tidy` naming rules as mandatory when adding or renaming identifiers; do not wait for nightly `clang-tidy` to catch violations. In particular, constants MUST follow `readability-identifier-naming`: local `const`/`constexpr` variables use `lower_case`, namespace-scope/file-static/static-member/`inline constexpr` constants use `kCamelCase`, and enum constants use unprefixed `CamelCase`. `tests/.clang-tidy` inherits the same naming policy, so test code has no naming exception.
- Any new functionality or feature MUST either add automated test coverage or add explicit coverage to the documented testing plan under `docs/`, following `docs/testing.md`, if the behavior cannot reasonably be covered automatically.
- Any bug fix MUST either add automated regression coverage for the faulty behavior or add explicit regression coverage to the documented testing plan under `docs/`, following `docs/testing.md`, if the behavior cannot reasonably be covered automatically.
- Prefer failing loudly over silently doing the wrong thing.
- When unsure, preserve correctness over convenience.
- Keep process/CLI exit codes in a single enum with globally unique numeric values. If codes change, update the README exit-code table.
- Debug root causes first; avoid adding new abstractions or code paths without clear need.
- Clang warning hygiene guidance lives in `docs/build.md`.
