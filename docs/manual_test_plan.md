# Human Test Plan

This plan covers behaviors that require real Windows UI, monitor, clipboard, filesystem,
registry, or shell integration. It is intentionally focused on manual-only coverage.

These areas are already covered by automated tests and should not be re-expanded here
unless a real end-to-end bug escapes into the Win32 shell:

- geometry and rect math
- DPI conversion math and monitor rules
- selection-handle calculations and snap logic policy
- annotation controller behavior and undo-stack rules
- output-path resolution and filename-pattern logic
- CLI parsing and most validation logic
- config normalization and string utility behavior

## How to use this plan

- Run the required build/test gates first: [build.md](build.md) and [testing.md](testing.md).
- Record failures by case ID only, for example `GF-MAN-OUT-003`.
- For routine changes, run all `P0` cases plus the `P1` cases in touched areas.
- For release validation, run every applicable case.

## Priority Levels

- `P0`: always run
- `P1`: standard functional coverage
- `P2`: edge case, environment-specific, or expensive

## Test Environments

| Label | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| `ENV-A` | Single monitor at 100% scale on Windows 11. |
| `ENV-B` | At least two monitors with mixed DPI, for example 100% + 150%, with one monitor placed left of or above the primary so the virtual desktop includes negative coordinates. |
| `ENV-C` | Disposable login session, VM snapshot, or other safe environment for startup-at-login and hotkey-conflict checks. |

## Common Setup

- Use a scratch output folder, for example `C:\Temp\greenflame-manual`.
- Keep Paint or another simple image editor open to verify clipboard image output.
- Keep File Explorer open to verify saved files and file-drop clipboard behavior.
- Use one visible Notepad window for single-window capture tests.
- Use two visible Notepad windows at once for ambiguous `--window` CLI tests.
- Start from a known config file at `%USERPROFILE%\.config\greenflame\greenflame.json`.

### GF-MAN-ANN-011 - Text Tool Activation And Style Defaults

- Priority: `P1`
- Run on: `ENV-A`
- Steps:
  1. Create a selection and activate the Text tool with `T`.
  2. Move the pointer inside the selection, then left-click to start a text draft.
  3. Cancel the draft, keep the Text tool armed, and right-click inside the selection.
  4. Use the mouse wheel and `Ctrl + =` / `Ctrl + -` before starting the next draft.
  5. Start a new draft and inspect the initial font, color, and point size.
- Expected:
  - The armed Text tool shows an `I-beam` cursor.
  - Left-click inside the selection starts a live text draft at the click point.
  - Right-click while the Text tool is armed opens the hub-and-ring text style wheel
    (see `GF-MAN-ANN-015`).
  - Pre-draft size stepping changes the default text point size for the next draft.
  - The next draft uses the chosen color, font, and point size.

### GF-MAN-ANN-015 - Text Style Wheel Hub-And-Ring

- Priority: `P1`
- Run on: `ENV-A`
- Steps:
  1. Create a selection, activate the Text tool, and right-click inside the selection
     with no draft active.
  2. Observe the wheel layout.
  3. Hover over the left hub semi-circle, then the right hub semi-circle.
  4. Click the left (color) hub semi-circle.
  5. Hover a color segment in the outer ring and click it.
  6. Reopen the wheel and click the right (font) hub semi-circle.
  7. Hover a font segment in the outer ring and click it.
  8. Reopen the wheel and press `Esc`.
  9. Reopen the wheel again and note which mode is active.
  10. Activate a non-Text annotation tool, right-click to open its color wheel, and
      compare the layout to the text style wheel.
- Expected:
  - The wheel shows a center hub with two semi-circles separated by a visible vertical
    gap.  The left semi-circle contains a small hue-spectrum gradient rectangle; the
    right semi-circle shows a lowercase `A` in the current font.
  - Hovering a hub semi-circle shows a green tint on that semi-circle; the outer ring
    is unchanged.
  - Color mode (initial): the outer ring shows 8 annotation color segments.  The active
    hub side (color) has an inverted (darker) fill.
  - Clicking the left hub when already in color mode is a no-op; the wheel stays open.
  - After selecting a color segment, the wheel closes and that color is used by the next
    text draft.
  - Font mode: the outer ring changes to 4 font segments each labeled with `A` in its
    font.  The right hub has the inverted fill.
  - After selecting a font segment, the wheel closes and that font is used by the next
    text draft.  The right-hub `A` updates when the wheel is reopened.
  - `Esc` closes the wheel without changing color or font.
  - Reopening the wheel opens in the mode last used in the session (font mode if font
    was the last mode selected).
  - Right-click while a text draft is active does not open the style wheel.
  - Non-text annotation color wheels show no hub; only a plain color ring.

  5. Exercise `Ctrl + A`, `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + X`, `Ctrl + V`, `Ctrl + Z`, and `Ctrl + Shift + Z`.
  6. Exercise `Ctrl + B`, `Ctrl + I`, `Ctrl + U`, `Alt + Shift + 5`, and `Ctrl + Enter`.
  7. Right-click while actively editing, then try mouse wheel and `Ctrl + =` / `Ctrl + -`.
- Expected:
  - `WM_CHAR` entry inserts printable characters at the caret.
  - Insert mode shows a thin caret and overwrite mode shows a block caret.
  - Caret blink timing follows the platform blink setting.
  - Mouse dragging updates the text selection highlight correctly.
  - Navigation and selection extension follow the expected word, line, and document boundaries.
  - Copy, cut, paste, select-all, and draft-local undo/redo affect only the active draft and do not trigger overlay-global undo/redo.
  - Bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough toggles apply correctly and do not insert extra text.
  - `Ctrl + Enter` inserts a newline into the active draft.
  - Right-click while actively editing does not open the style wheel.

  5. Start a non-empty text draft and press `Enter`.
  6. Start another non-empty text draft and press `Esc`.
- Expected:
  - Clicking outside an empty draft discards it and starts the next draft at the new click point.
  - Clicking outside a non-empty draft commits it and starts the next draft at the new click point.
  - Clicking a toolbar button while editing discards an empty draft or commits a non-empty draft, then applies the button action without starting a new text draft at the button location.
  - `Enter` commits the active draft.
  - `Esc` cancels the active draft and keeps the Text tool armed.
