# Human Test Plan

This plan covers behaviors that require real Windows UI, monitor, clipboard, filesystem,
registry, or shell integration. It is intentionally focused on manual-only coverage.

These areas are already covered by automated tests and should not be re-expanded here
unless a real end-to-end bug escapes into the Win32 shell:

- geometry and rect math
- DPI conversion math and monitor rules
- selection-handle calculations and snap logic policy
- annotation controller behavior and undo-stack rules
- output-path resolution and filename-pattern logic
- CLI parsing and most validation logic
- config normalization and string utility behavior

## How to use this plan

- Run the required build/test gates first: [build.md](build.md) and [testing.md](testing.md).
- Record failures by case ID only, for example `GF-MAN-OUT-003`.
- For routine changes, run all `P0` cases plus the `P1` cases in touched areas.
- For release validation, run every applicable case.

## Priority Levels

- `P0`: always run
- `P1`: standard functional coverage
- `P2`: edge case, environment-specific, or expensive

## Test Environments

| Label | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| `ENV-A` | Single monitor at 100% scale on Windows 11. |
| `ENV-B` | At least two monitors with mixed DPI, for example 100% + 150%, with one monitor placed left of or above the primary so the virtual desktop includes negative coordinates. |
| `ENV-C` | Disposable login session, VM snapshot, or other safe environment for startup-at-login and hotkey-conflict checks. |

## Common Setup

- Use a scratch output folder, for example `C:\Temp\greenflame-manual`.
- Keep Paint or another simple image editor open to verify clipboard image output.
- Keep File Explorer open to verify saved files and file-drop clipboard behavior.
- Use one visible Notepad window for single-window capture tests.
- Use two visible Notepad windows at once for ambiguous `--window` CLI tests.
- Start from a known config file at `%USERPROFILE%\.config\greenflame\greenflame.ini`.
