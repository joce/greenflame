## Usage

### Starting a capture

**Run** `greenflame.exe`. The executable sits in the tray.

Press the **Print Screen** key, or **left-click** the tray icon to start an interactive capture. Alternatively, **right-click** the tray icon and choose a capture mode from the context menu.

The tray menu also includes a persisted `Include captured cursor` toggle for the
default live-capture behavior, next to the other app-level settings.

---

### Selecting a region

In interactive mode, the screen is captured and a region is selected:

- **Click and drag** to select a rectangle (hold **Alt** to disable snapping).
- **Ctrl** + click ➜ select the window under the cursor. While `Ctrl` is held,
  Greenflame lifts the pending window preview above occluding windows. If that
  window extends off-screen, the full window is still captured, but only the
  visible on-desktop portion is editable; while the interactive size label is
  shown, a smaller note under the center `width x height` label indicates that
  off-screen pixels are included, and the size labels continue to reflect the
  full captured window size. If you manually move or resize that selection, it
  immediately becomes a normal region selection.
- **Shift** + click ➜ select the whole monitor under the cursor.
- **Shift+Ctrl** + click ➜ select the whole desktop.

Once a region is selected:

- **Drag the handles** on the selection to resize (hold **Alt** to disable snapping).
- Use the **captured cursor** button on the toolbar, or press **Ctrl+K**, to show or
  hide the cursor that was sampled from the captured screen image. This affects the
  frozen screenshot only, not the live editing pointer.
- Use the **pin** button on the toolbar, or press **Ctrl+P**, to create an
  always-on-top pinned image from the current rendered selection. On success, the
  overlay closes and the pin stays on screen. Pins created from the interactive
  `Ctrl` window path use the full captured window bitmap at 100% scale, so they may
  initially appear partly off-screen when the source window extended beyond the
  desktop.

With **no annotation tool selected** (the default mode):

- **Click and drag inside the selection** to **move** it (hold **Alt** to disable snapping).
- **Click and drag an annotation** to **select** it; once selected, drag anywhere inside its selection box to move it.
- **Ctrl+click** an annotation to add it to or remove it from the current annotation selection.
- **Ctrl+drag** a marquee to add every touched annotation to the current selection.
- When **multiple annotations** are selected, drag anywhere inside the group selection box to move the whole group.
- A **selected line or arrow annotation** shows draggable endpoint handles you can drag to reshape it.
- When **exactly one** rectangle, ellipse, or obfuscate annotation is selected, it shows draggable resize handles on the corners and sides.

### Annotation tools

Press a hotkey or use the toolbar to toggle a tool on or off.

| Hotkey | Tool |
|--------|------|
| **B** | Brush |
| **H** | Highlighter |
| **L** | Line |
| **A** | Arrow |
| **R** | Rectangle |
| **Shift+R** | Filled Rectangle |
| **E** | Ellipse |
| **Shift+E** | Filled Ellipse |
| **O** | Obfuscate |
| **T** | Text |
| **N** | Bubble |

**Bubble:** Left-click inside the selection to place a numbered circle. The number auto-increments with each placement and decrements on undo. Right-click opens a style wheel; a central hub switches it between 8 color slots and 4 font choices. The number color is chosen automatically for contrast (black on light fills, white on dark fills).

**Highlighter:** While drawing, holding the mouse still for 800 ms snaps the stroke to a straight bar from the start point to the cursor. After snapping, the end of the bar tracks the mouse live until release — the snap is one-way and cannot be reverted to freehand. The wait time is configurable via `tools.highlighter.pause_straighten_ms` (see [Configuration](#configuration)); setting it to `0` makes every stroke start as a straight bar immediately.

**Obfuscate:** Drag out a rectangle to blur or pixelate the content underneath it. `tools.obfuscate.block_size = 1` uses blur mode; `2..50` uses block pixelation. Obfuscates can be moved and resized later, and they recompute when lower overlapping annotations change.

### Tool options

**Color:** With an annotation tool other than **Obfuscate** active, **right-click** anywhere (or press **Tab**) to open that tool's **selection wheel** at the cursor. Left-click a segment or press **Enter** to select it. Use **mouse-wheel up/down** or **↑ / ↓** to navigate between segments without the mouse. Press **Escape** to dismiss without selecting. For Text and Bubble, the wheel has a central hub that switches between 8 color slots and 4 font choices; pressing **Tab** while the wheel is open cycles between the color and font views.

**Size:** With **Brush**, **Highlighter**, **Line**, **Arrow**, **Rectangle**, **Ellipse**, **Bubble**, **Obfuscate**, or **Text** active, use **mouse-wheel up/down** or **Ctrl+= / Ctrl+-** to change that tool's size step (1–50). Each tool has its own independent persisted setting. For Obfuscate, the setting is `block_size`: `1` means blur and `2..50` means block pixelation.

**Cursor previews:**

- **Brush** and **Bubble** — anti-aliased circular preview around the cursor hotspot.
- **Highlighter**, **Line**, **Rectangle**, **Ellipse**, and **Obfuscate** — anti-aliased axis-aligned square preview around the cursor hotspot.
- **Arrow** — anti-aliased square preview aligned to the current arrow direction.
- **Text** — the letter "A" in the current font and size, shown beside the cursor hotspot.
- **Filled Rectangle** and **Filled Ellipse** — no cursor preview.

### Text tool

With the Text tool active and no draft open:

- **Left-click inside the selection** to start a text annotation at the click point.
- **Right-click** (or **Tab**) to open the selection wheel. A central hub switches between 8 annotation-color slots and 4 font choices.
- **Mouse-wheel up/down** or **Ctrl+= / Ctrl+-** to change text size step (1–50, mapped to 5–288 pt). The chosen step is persisted.

While editing a draft:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl+A / C / X / V** | Clipboard operations on the draft |
| **Ctrl-Z / Ctrl-Shift-Z** | Undo / redo within the draft |
| **Ctrl+B / I / U** | Bold / italic / underline |
| **Alt+Shift+5** | Strikethrough |
| **Insert** | Toggle insert / overwrite mode |
| **Ctrl+Enter** | Insert a newline |
| **Enter** | Commit the draft |
| **Escape** | Cancel the draft, keep Text tool armed |

Clicking outside a draft commits it if it has text, otherwise discards it. Clicking a toolbar button does the same before applying the button action.

Committed text annotations can be selected, moved, and deleted, but are not re-editable as live text.

Live **spell-check squiggles** appear under misspelled words while editing a draft. Configure one or more BCP-47 language tags in `tools.text.spell_check_languages` (e.g. `["en-US", "fr-CA"]`). Squiggles are visible only during editing and never appear in saved images. When multiple languages are configured, a word is only flagged if all languages agree it is misspelled.

### Saving, copying, and pinning

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl-S** | Save directly to the configured default save folder in the configured format, then close |
| **Ctrl-Shift-S** | Open **Save As** dialog, then save and close |
| **Ctrl-Alt-S** | Save directly in the configured format, copy the saved file to the clipboard, then close |
| **Ctrl-Shift-Alt-S** | Open **Save As** dialog, save, copy the saved file to the clipboard, then close |
| **Ctrl-C** | Copy the selection to the clipboard, then close |
| **Ctrl-P** | Pin the rendered selection to the desktop, then close |

**Save As** supports **PNG**, **JPEG**, and **BMP**.

When the captured cursor is shown, it is composited into the screenshot below all
annotations. It is never selectable or movable.

### Pinned images

Pinned images are frameless, always-on-top reference windows with an always-visible
green halo. The halo gets stronger when the pin is active. Multiple pins can stay
open at once.

- **Drag anywhere on the pin** to move it.
- Use the **mouse wheel** or **Ctrl+= / Ctrl+-** to zoom in or out.
- Pin zoom is clamped to **25% .. 800%**.
- **Right-click** the pin to open its context menu.
- Pins resize by zoom only; there are no border or corner resize handles.
- Copy/save actions include the current **rotation**, but on-screen **opacity** and
  the green halo are display-only and are not baked into the exported image.

Pin-window shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl-C** | Copy the active pinned image to the clipboard |
| **Ctrl-S** | Save the active pinned image to a file |
| **Ctrl-Right** | Rotate the active pin right |
| **Ctrl-Left** | Rotate the active pin left |
| **Ctrl+= / Ctrl+-** | Zoom the active pin in or out |
| **Ctrl-Up / Ctrl-Down** | Increase or decrease the active pin opacity; holding the keys repeats |
| **Escape** | Close the active pin |

### Other shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl-K** | Show or hide the captured cursor in this screenshot |
| **Delete** | Remove the selected annotation or annotation group |
| **Ctrl-Z** | Undo the last region or annotation change |
| **Ctrl-Shift-Z** | Redo the last undone region or annotation change |
| **Escape** | Cancel or go back |

---

## Hotkeys

All hotkeys use the **Print Screen** key with modifier combinations. They are also available from the tray icon's right-click context menu.

| Hotkey | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Prt Scrn** | Start interactive capture (select a region) |
| **Ctrl + Prt Scrn** | Copy the current window to the clipboard |
| **Shift + Prt Scrn** | Copy the current monitor to the clipboard |
| **Ctrl + Shift + Prt Scrn** | Copy the full desktop to the clipboard |
| **Alt + Prt Scrn** | Recapture the last captured region (same screen coordinates) |
| **Ctrl + Alt + Prt Scrn** | Recapture the last captured window (wherever it is now) |

The last two hotkeys require a previous capture in the current session. If no previous capture exists, or if the previously captured window has been closed or minimized, a warning toast is shown.

These direct clipboard captures honor the persisted `capture.include_cursor` setting.
They do not open the overlay, so there is no post-capture cursor toggle in those flows.

---

## Command-line mode

With no parameters, Greenflame starts normally in the tray.

You can also run one-shot command-line modes (at most one mode per invocation):

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-r, --region <x,y,w,h>` | Capture an explicit physical-pixel region |
| `-w, --window <name>` | Capture a visible top-level window by title text; a unique exact-title match wins over broader substring matches |
| `--window-hwnd <hex>` | Capture a visible top-level window by exact hex HWND |
| `-m, --monitor <id>` | Capture monitor by 1-based id |
| `-d, --desktop` | Capture the full virtual desktop |
| `--input <path>` | Load an existing PNG/JPEG/BMP image, apply `--annotate`, and save the result |
| `-h, --help` | Show help and exit |
| `-v, --version` | Show version and exit |

Optional:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output <path>` | Output file path (valid only with a render source) |
| `-t, --format <png\|jpg\|jpeg\|bmp>` | Output format override |
| `-p, --padding <n\|h,v\|l,t,r,b>` | Add synthetic padding around the rendered image in physical pixels |
| `--padding-color <#rrggbb>` | Override the padding color for this invocation only (valid only with `--padding`) |
| `--annotate <json\|path>` | Apply JSON-defined annotations to the saved CLI render result |
| `--window-capture <auto\|gdi\|wgc>` | CLI-only window-capture backend for `--window` / `--window-hwnd`; defaults to `auto` |
| `--cursor` | Include the captured cursor for this live-capture invocation only |
| `--no-cursor` | Exclude the captured cursor for this live-capture invocation only |
| `-f, --overwrite` | Allow replacing an existing explicit `--output` file |

Both `--option=value` and `--option value` forms are supported.

Examples:

```bat
greenflame.exe --desktop
greenflame.exe --desktop --format jpeg
greenflame.exe --desktop --padding 12
greenflame.exe --monitor 2 --output "D:\shots\monitor2.png"
greenflame.exe --monitor 2 --padding 24,12 --padding-color "#ffffff"
greenflame.exe --window "Notepad" --output "D:\shots\note" --format jpg
greenflame.exe --window "Notepad" --window-capture wgc --output "D:\shots\note-wgc.png"
greenflame.exe --window "Notepad" --window-capture wgc --cursor --output "D:\shots\note-wgc-cursor.png"
greenflame.exe --window-hwnd 0x0000000000123456 --output "D:\shots\exact-window.png"
greenflame.exe --window "Notepad" --output "D:\shots\note.jpg" --overwrite
greenflame.exe --window="Notepad" --output "D:\shots\note"
greenflame.exe --region 1200,100,800,600
greenflame.exe --region 1200,100,800,600 --padding 8,16,24,32
greenflame.exe --desktop --annotate "{\"annotations\":[{\"type\":\"line\",\"start\":{\"x\":20,\"y\":20},\"end\":{\"x\":220,\"y\":120},\"size\":4}]}"
greenflame.exe --desktop --padding 64 --annotate ".\\schemas\\examples\\cli_annotations\\global_padding_edge_cases.json"
greenflame.exe --input "D:\shots\issue.png" --overwrite --annotate ".\\note.json"
greenflame.exe --input "D:\shots\issue.jpg" --output "D:\shots\issue-annotated" --annotate ".\\note.json"
```

**Padding**

- `--padding` accepts one value (`n`), two values (`h,v`), or four values
  (`l,t,r,b`).
- Padding is always synthetic color; it never captures extra screen pixels.
- When `--padding` is present, any part of the requested capture area that lies
  outside the virtual desktop is filled with the resolved padding color instead
  of being clipped away.
- Padding color resolution order is:
  1. `--padding-color`, if provided
  2. `save.padding_color` from config
  3. default black (`#000000`)

**Annotations**

- `--annotate` applies JSON-defined annotations to the saved CLI render result, using either inline JSON or a UTF-8 JSON file.
- `--input` is valid only with `--annotate`.
- `--input` requires either `--output` or `--overwrite`.
- `--input --overwrite` without `--output` writes back to the input path.
- `--input` is incompatible with live capture modes and with `--window-capture`.
- `--input` is also incompatible with `--cursor` and `--no-cursor`.
- Imported images support only local coordinates. `coordinate_space: "global"` fails with exit code `14`.
- Imported images must decode fully opaque in V1. Any non-opaque alpha fails with exit code `16`.
- See [docs/cli_annotations.md](docs/cli_annotations.md) for the full format, schema/examples, coordinate rules, and validation behavior.

**Captured cursor**

- Live CLI captures use `capture.include_cursor` from config by default.
- `--cursor` and `--no-cursor` override that setting for one invocation only.
- These overrides do not modify the saved config file.

**CLI window capture backends**

- `--window-capture` is CLI-only and applies only to `--window` and `--window-hwnd`.
- `auto` prefers Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) and falls back to GDI if WGC backend setup fails for that window.
- Forced `wgc` does not fall back; backend failures exit with code `15`.
- See [docs/cli_window_capture.md](docs/cli_window_capture.md) for backend semantics, warning behavior, and examples.

**Window matching**

- `--window <name>` still starts with a case-insensitive substring search.
- If that search finds exactly one case-insensitive exact-title match, Greenflame
  captures that exact-title window automatically.
- If multiple windows still remain ambiguous, the error output lists each candidate
  with its `hwnd`, window class, and rect so you can rerun with `--window-hwnd`.

**Output format**

1. If `--output` has a supported extension (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`), that extension defines the format.
2. Otherwise, if `--format` is provided, `--format` defines the format.
3. Otherwise, with `--input`, an extensionless explicit `--output` preserves the probed input-image format.
4. Otherwise, `save.default_save_format` (from the config) defines the format.
5. If `--output` extension conflicts with `--format`, the command fails.
6. If `--output` has an unsupported extension (for example `.tiff`), the command fails.
7. If `--output` has no extension, Greenflame appends one based on the resolved format.
8. If `--input --overwrite` writes back to the input path, any explicit `--format` must match the input image format.

### Exit codes

Greenflame uses these process exit codes for command-line invocations. Non-zero
codes are unique and not reused.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success (includes `--help`, `--version`, and "already running" tray startup) |
| `1` | Failed to register application window classes |
| `2` | CLI argument parse/validation failed |
| `3` | Failed to create tray window |
| `4` | Failed to enforce single-instance tray mode |
| `5` | `--region` capture requested but region data is missing |
| `6` | `--window` matched no visible window |
| `7` | `--window` matched multiple windows (ambiguous) |
| `8` | `--monitor` capture requested but no monitors are available |
| `9` | `--monitor` id is out of range |
| `10` | Output path resolution/reservation failed |
| `11` | Capture/save operation failed |
| `12` | Matched window became unavailable before capture |
| `13` | Matched window is minimized |
| `14` | `--annotate` input is invalid (file read, JSON, validation, or missing explicit font family) |
| `15` | Forced `--window-capture wgc` failed (unsupported, setup/frame failure, or WGC/window size mismatch) |
| `16` | `--input` image is unreadable or unsupported (decode failure, unsupported image format, or transparency rejection) |
| `17` | `--window` or `--window-hwnd` matched a window with `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` display affinity; it cannot be captured |
| `18` | CLI obfuscate usage was rejected because `tools.obfuscate.risk_acknowledged` is not yet `true` |

---

## Configuration

Greenflame reads `~/.config/greenflame/greenflame.json` (i.e. `%USERPROFILE%\.config\greenflame\greenflame.json`).

### Capture settings (`capture.*`)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `capture.include_cursor` | `false` | Include the captured cursor by default for live captures. Interactive overlay captures can still toggle it per capture with **Ctrl+K** or the toolbar button. |

### UI settings (`ui.*`)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ui.show_balloons` | `true` | Show tray toast notifications after copy/save actions. |
| `ui.show_selection_size_side_labels` | `true` | Show selection-size labels outside the selection (width on top/bottom and height on left/right). |
| `ui.show_selection_size_center_label` | `true` | Show centered `W x H` selection-size label inside the selection. |
| `ui.tool_size_overlay_duration_ms` | `800` | How long the centered tool-size overlay stays visible after a stroke-width change. `0` disables it. |

### Tool settings (`tools.*`)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tools.brush.size` | `2` | Brush tool size step (1–50). |
| `tools.brush.smoothing_mode` | `smooth` | Freehand Brush smoothing mode. Accepted values: `off`, `smooth`. `smooth` affects both committed strokes and the live split-tail preview. |
| `tools.line.size` | `2` | Line tool size step (1–50). |
| `tools.arrow.size` | `2` | Arrow tool size step (1–50). |
| `tools.rect.size` | `2` | Rectangle tool size step (1–50). |
| `tools.ellipse.size` | `2` | Ellipse tool size step (1–50). |
| `tools.colors` | Object with slot index keys (e.g. `{"4": "#ff00ff"}`) | Annotation selection wheel slots (indices 0–7). Only non-default slots are written. Values use `#rrggbb`. |
| `tools.current_color` | `0` | Current annotation color slot index, clamped to `0..7`. |
| `tools.font.sans` | `Arial` | Font family for the `sans` slot (shared by Text and Bubble tools). |
| `tools.font.serif` | `Times New Roman` | Font family for the `serif` slot. |
| `tools.font.mono` | `Courier New` | Font family for the `mono` slot. |
| `tools.font.art` | `Comic Sans MS` | Font family for the `art` slot. |
| `tools.highlighter.size` | `10` | Highlighter size step (1–50). |
| `tools.highlighter.colors` | Object with slot index keys (e.g. `{"2": "#ffb44d"}`) | Highlighter selection wheel slots (indices 0–5). Only non-default slots are written. Values use `#rrggbb`. |
| `tools.highlighter.current_color` | `0` | Current Highlighter color slot index, clamped to `0..5`. |
| `tools.highlighter.opacity_percent` | `35` | Default Highlighter opacity for live preview, save output, and clipboard output. Values are clamped to `0..100`. |
| `tools.highlighter.smoothing_mode` | `smooth` | Freehand Highlighter smoothing mode. Accepted values: `off`, `smooth`. Straightened highlighter bars bypass this setting and stay explicit `start`/`end` segments. |
| `tools.highlighter.pause_straighten_ms` | `800` | After the mouse is still for this many milliseconds during a highlighter stroke, the stroke snaps to a straight bar (start to cursor). `0` means always straight. |
| `tools.highlighter.pause_straighten_deadzone_px` | `0` | Mouse must move more than this many physical pixels from the last timer-reset position before the pause timer resets. `0` means any movement resets the timer. |
| `tools.text.size` | `10` | Text tool size step (1–50). |
| `tools.text.current_font` | `sans` | Active font slot for the Text tool. Accepted values: `sans`, `serif`, `mono`, `art`. |
| `tools.text.spell_check_languages` | `[]` | List of BCP-47 language tags (e.g. `["en-US"]` or `["en-US", "fr-CA"]`) for live spell-check squiggles during text editing. Empty list disables spell checking. A word is only underlined if **all** listed checkers agree it is misspelled, so mixing languages avoids false positives. Unsupported tags trigger a tray warning and are silently skipped. Changes take effect without restarting the app. |
| `tools.bubble.size` | `10` | Bubble size step (1–50). |
| `tools.bubble.current_font` | `sans` | Active font slot for the Bubble tool. Accepted values: `sans`, `serif`, `mono`, `art`. |
| `tools.obfuscate.block_size` | `10` | Obfuscate tool block size (1–50). `1` uses blur mode; `2..50` uses block pixelation. |
| `tools.obfuscate.risk_acknowledged` | `false` | Whether the Obfuscate warning has been explicitly accepted. CLI obfuscate usage requires this to be `true`. |

### Save settings (`save.*`)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `save.default_save_dir` | `%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\greenflame` (runtime fallback when unset) | Folder used by **Ctrl-S**, **Ctrl-Alt-S**, and CLI captures when `--output` is not provided. |
| `save.last_save_as_dir` | Falls back to `default_save_dir`, then `%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\greenflame` | Initial folder used by **Ctrl-Shift-S** and **Ctrl-Shift-Alt-S** (Save As). |
| `save.default_save_format` | `png` | Default image format for **Ctrl-S**, **Ctrl-Alt-S**, and CLI output paths without explicit extension. Accepted values: `png`, `jpg`, `bmp`. |
| `save.padding_color` | `#000000` | Padding color used by CLI captures when `--padding` is present and `--padding-color` is not supplied. Values use `#rrggbb`. |
| `save.filename_pattern_region` | `screenshot-${YYYY}-${MM}-${DD}_${hh}${mm}${ss}` | Default filename pattern for region captures. |
| `save.filename_pattern_desktop` | `screenshot-${YYYY}-${MM}-${DD}_${hh}${mm}${ss}` | Default filename pattern for desktop captures. |
| `save.filename_pattern_monitor` | `screenshot-${YYYY}-${MM}-${DD}_${hh}${mm}${ss}-monitor${monitor}` | Default filename pattern for monitor captures. |
| `save.filename_pattern_window` | `screenshot-${YYYY}-${MM}-${DD}_${hh}${mm}${ss}-${title}` | Default filename pattern for window captures. |

### Save filenames

Saved files use one pattern per capture type and Greenshot-style `${VARIABLE}` placeholders.

#### Supported variables

| Variable | Expansion | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `${YYYY}` | 4-digit year | `2026` |
| `${YY}` | 2-digit year | `26` |
| `${MM}` | 2-digit month | `02` |
| `${DD}` | 2-digit day | `21` |
